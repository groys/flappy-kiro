# Placeholder for jump sound effect
# In a real implementation, this would be a .wav or .ogg file
# For now, you can:
# 1. Generate sounds using tools like sfxr, bfxr, or ChipTone
# 2. Record your own sounds
# 3. Use free sound libraries like freesound.org
# 
# Recommended: Short "whoosh" or "flap" sound (0.1-0.2 seconds)
