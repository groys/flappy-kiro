# Ghosty Sprite Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the Ghosty character sprite.

## To add pixel art:

1. Create a 40x40 pixel image in your favorite pixel art tool (Aseprite, Piskel, GIMP, etc.)
2. Design a simple ghost character (white/gray with eyes)
3. Save as PNG with transparency
4. Name it `ghosty.png` and place in this directory
5. In Godot, replace the ColorRect in the Player node with a Sprite2D node
6. Assign the ghosty.png texture to the Sprite2D

## Quick pixel art tips:
- Keep it simple (this is a 40x40 sprite)
- Use 2-3 colors max
- Make sure it's clearly visible against the blue background
- Add simple eyes for character

## Alternative:
You can continue using the white ColorRect placeholder - it works fine for gameplay testing!
