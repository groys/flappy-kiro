# Wall Sprite Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the wall obstacle sprite.

## To add pixel art:

1. Create an 80x600 pixel image in your favorite pixel art tool
2. Design a simple wall texture (brick pattern, pipes, etc.)
3. Save as PNG
4. Name it `wall.png` and place in this directory
5. In Godot, replace the ColorRect in the Wall scene with a Sprite2D node
6. Assign the wall.png texture to the Sprite2D

## Alternative:
The green ColorRect placeholder works fine for gameplay!
